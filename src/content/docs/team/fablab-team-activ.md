## Zidan - 4/9/2019
- making key chain for the fablab keys
- ![zidann](../../../assets/docs/team/zidann.jpg)
    - first design
        1. I made a rectangle with diminutions 3cm x 5cm that contains `A` letter.
        2. I made 2 circles with diameter 5mm.
        3. I changed the setting of the lines of the triangle and circles to hair line to allow the laser cutter to cut them.
        4. I repeat these steps 7 times, with changing the latter from A to B, C, E, F, G, H and S.
        - ![zidan1](../../../assets/docs/team/zidan-laser1.jpg)

    - second design
        1. I made rectangle with dimentions 30cm*5cm that contains 7 letters and under each letter a circle with diameter 5mm.
        2. I chanced the setting of the lines of the triangle to hair line.
        - ![zidan8](../../../assets/docs/team/zidan-laser8.jpg)
        - ![zidan9](../../../assets/docs/team/zidan-laser9.jpg)
    - Finally
        - I made the power of milling `100` and the speed `15` and the power of the cutting `100` and the speed `45`.

## Zidan - 3/9/2019
![zidan](../../../assets/docs/team/zidan.JPG)
    - using freecad to design a pyramid and print it on 3d printer
    - I made the layers that was:
        1. first layer was 5cm width, 5cm length and 1cm height.
        - ![zidan1](../../../assets/docs/team/zidan1.jpg)
        - ![zidan2](../../../assets/docs/team/zidan2.jpg)
        2. second layer was 4cm length, 4cm width and 1 cm height.
        - ![zidan3](../../../assets/docs/team/zidan3.jpg)
        3. third layer was 3cm length, 3cm width and 1cm height.
        - ![zidan5](../../../assets/docs/team/zidan5.jpg)
        4. Fourth layer was 2cm length, 2cm width and 1cm height.
        - ![zidan4](../../../assets/docs/team/zidan4.jpg)
        - ![zidan6](../../../assets/docs/team/zidan6.jpg)
        5. Last layer was cubic 1\*1\*1.
        - ![zidan7](../../../assets/docs/team/zidan7.jpg)
    - Then I grouped them into one shape.
    - After that I saved the project as `stl`.
    - Then used cura application to convert it to `gcode` and saved it in SD card
    - Finally, I put the card in the 3D printer to start print. It takes 1.15 hour to protect this shape.
    - [pyramid file](/team/pyramid.stl)

## Nourhan - 2/9/2019
![nourhan](../../../assets/docs/team/nourhan.JPG)
    - installing windows OS on machine's computers
    - installing ubuntu OS on machine's computers
    - organizing fablab according to the new layout
