## What is jekyll

- Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it churns through layouts to create a static website.
- Jekyll is written in Ruby
- A gem is code you can include in Ruby projects, It allows you to package up functionality and share it across other projects or with other people
- Gems can perform functionality such as
  - Converting a Ruby object to JSON
  - Pagination
  - Interacting with APIs `what is API : When you use an application on your mobile phone, the application connects to the Internet and sends data to a server. The server then retrieves that data, interprets it, performs the necessary actions and sends it back to your phone. The application then interprets that data and presents you with the information you wanted in a readable way. This is what an API is - all of this happens via API` such as GitHub
  - Jekyll itself is a gem as well as many Jekyll plugins including jekyll-feed, jekyll-seo-tag and jekyll-archives
- A Gemfile is a list of gems required for your site
- Bundler installs the gems in your Gemfile
- It’s not a requirement for you to use a Gemfile and bundler, You only need to install it once — not every time you create a new Jekyll project
- Jekyll is a static site generator so we need Jekyll to build the site before we can view it.
